# Decentralized Finance System on Bitfinity-EVM

# Overview
This project presents a robust DeFi system, leveraging the Bitfinity-EVM of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This project initially focuses on ERC20 tokens for its main functionalities, which include Swapping, Staking, and Lending & Borrowing smart contracts.
It encompasses three primary smart contracts: Swapping, Staking, and Lending & Borrowing.
Each contract is uniquely designed to facilitate specific financial functionalities in a decentralized environment.

## Swapping Contract
This contract is designed to provides a platform for exchanging various ERC20 digital assets. 
The key focus is on ensuring that asset exchange is carried out with maximum security and efficiency, catering to a wide range of ERC20 tokens
and ensuring the the utilization of the different ICP principles of functioning.

## Staking Contract
-The Staking Contract in the DeFi system on Bitfinity-EVM offers a unique and flexible staking mechanism for ERC20 tokens.
 It introduces both fixed and flexible staking options.
 Fixed staking comes with predefined intervals, including one-week, two-week, and 60-day periods, catering to different investment strategies.
 This feature is a significant advantage, as it allows users to earn rewards based on their preferred staking duration. 
 The flexibility in staking terms aligns with the principles of decentralized finance, incentivizing participation and promoting asset growth. 
  This versatile approach to staking enhances user engagement and offers varied investment opportunities within the platform.

  ## Lending & Borrowing Contract
  Central to the ecosystem, this contract enables users to lend their ERC20 tokens to earn interest or borrow against their holdings. 
  The Lending & Borrowing Contract in the Bitfinity-EVM ecosystem significantly enriches the DeFi experience by incorporating innovative Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) concepts. 
  It ensures fair price of rates using the on chain ICP oracle(to be implimentated).
   The integration of ICP concepts enhances security and scalability, offering a decentralized finance experience that is more robust and efficient. 
   This approach improves transaction speeds and reduces costs, thereby altering the user experience compared to traditional staking protocols.

# Getting Started with Hardhat
This project is initialized using Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum(Now incooperated with the Bifinity-EVM). 
To start:

## Install Hardhat:
bash 
npm install --save-dev hardhat

## Initialize your Hardhat project:
bash
npx hardhat


# Roadmap
The planned future updates for the DeFi system on Bitfinity-EVM are set to extend its functionality beyond the ERC20 token standard. 
-By integrating with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and leveraging the Bitfinity EVM, 
the platform aims to support a broader spectrum of digital assets and standards.
-This expansion is not only about including more token types but also about harnessing the unique features of ICP — such as enhanced scalability and interoperability — 
to offer a more versatile and efficient DeFi experience. 
-This will potentially open up new avenues for decentralized finance, making the platform more inclusive and adaptable to various digital assets, 
thereby significantly enhancing its utility in the DeFi space.
